Project Goal
    The objective of this project is to mitigate data breaches and the exposure of confidential data. Through the process of port scanning, security experts can identify open ports and services within a network, thereby enabling them to detect potential security weaknesses.

The problem you are solving (i.e. automate data extraction from a pcap file).
    Port scanners play a vital role in the realm of cybersecurity due to their capacity to identify vulnerabilities, specifically open ports. The act of pinpointing security weaknesses and susceptibilities within computer systems and software is commonly referred to as vulnerability scanning. Consequently, any comprehensive vulnerability management strategy should encompass scanning as a fundamental element.

Expected Outcomes and Deliverables
	The script was executed using Visual Studio Code to identify any potential issues. Additionally, the script provides a detailed explanation of each line's functionality, enabling us to anticipate the outcome during execution. The designated host target is www.hackthissite.org (137.74.187.100), a platform that offers ethical hackers a secure and lawful environment to enhance their ethical hacking skills through various challenges. This site is also suitable for Penetration Testing, making it a favorable choice as a host.
    A single host allows for the scanning of 65,535 ports, commencing from port 0. However, the script is specifically programmed to scan a range of ports from 0 to 10, aiming to minimize the waiting time for results. Consequently, all ports within this range were found to be closed after the scan, which took approximately 126.28 seconds.
    
Timeline
    The project commenced with research on port scanners, followed by the implementation phase involving code development, module installation, and the formulation of a timeline to measure the duration of port scanning. The project was successfully accomplished within a week.
